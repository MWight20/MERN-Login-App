#TO-DO
```
- Add CSS
- modify modularity of Fetch API calls to belong in their own folder
- Find a way for page to reload automatically on signin and logout: navbar doesn't load "home","content", and "logout" without manual refresh

-Model signin and register as a form instead of button event. (or find a way to click enter to start event)

```
